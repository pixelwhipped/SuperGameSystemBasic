The SGS system follows many existing paradigms but also has some unusual aspects as well.
The idea is to keep the language simple and familiar and allow the actual output to be both interesting and fun.
SGS processes like a normal system except it's graphics are processed separately by the TGA(Text Graphics Accelerator) which is why the BLIT call must be made to update the screen.
Built in functions have a degree of fault tolerance to prevent continual crashes.
Timing in games is important this is why there are built in TIMER(s) which can be utilised for ease of use.
Audio is available to a limited degree.
Some of these are reasons YEILD is required to allow the system to process background tasks and also provides a means of controlling the speed of you programs and games.
