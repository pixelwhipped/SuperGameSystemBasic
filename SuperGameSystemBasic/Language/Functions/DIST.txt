DIST: result DIST(expr, expr)
      result DIST(expr, expr, expr, expr)
Returns the distance between two point x1,y1,x2,y2 or between two strings or numbers
If a string is longer that 1 character then the levenshtein distance algorithm is used which is really helpfull for dertermining string likeness
Think of the example below as a triangle where a = 3 and b = 4
the hypotenuse is 5,  Yep the teacher was right math is important.
example
PRINT(DIST(0,0,3,4))
output: 5
