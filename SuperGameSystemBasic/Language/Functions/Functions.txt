Functions
 
Functions, a function is a type of procedure or routine. The SGS System makes no distinction between a procedure and routine and all of wich take 0 or more arguments, and return an expressable value.
The returned value may be redundant and most functions are desinged to tolerate a degree of fault.
Unlike other langauges SGS Basic tries to make coding and development less prone to system failure.
The cons of this is more unexpected results unless untested but less chance of the dredded system failure or halt.

Funtions are divided up into
Mathimatical and Numerical, Graphics, Audio, System or Control and String Functions
