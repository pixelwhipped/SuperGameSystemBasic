Repeats a group of statements a number of times.
FOR [VARIABLE] = (expr) TO (expr) STEP (expr)
   ....Statements
NEXT [VARIABLE]
 
example 2
DIM numbers = 10
REM DIM's are 0 based so we want to
REM set the range 0 to 9
FOR x = 0 TO LEN(numbers)-1
numbers[x] = x
NEXT x 
result is numbers now = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
 
example 2
FOR x = 0 TO 10 STEP 2
PRINT(x + " ")
NEXT x 
BLIT
output 0 2 4 6 8 10
 
example 3
FOR x = 10 TO 0 STEP -2
PRINT(x + " ")
NEXT x 
BLIT
output 10 8 6 4 2 0
